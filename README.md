1. Implement function which creates a  ùëõùë•ùëö  matrix and fills it with a checkerboard pattern
2. Implement function which solves system of linear equations
3. Implement function which multiplies 2 matrixes and returns the max value of each column of the resulting matrix
4. Implement function add_mean_and_calc_det(matrix), which adds to each element in the matrix row the mean of this row and returns the determinant of the resulting matrix
5. Implement function nearest_to_scalar(matrix, n), which returns the closest to n number in the matrix
6. Implement function svd_ranks(Z) which performs SVD of given matrix and returns a list of ranks of matrices U, S and V
6. Implement function svd_ranks(Z) which performs SVD of given matrix and returns a list of ranks of matrices U, S and V
7. Implement function to sort a given complex array using the real part first, then the imaginary part
8. Implement a function that computes the Mandelbrot fractal
9. Consider the following dictionary "data" and list "labels"
9.1 Implement function repl_nan(data, labels) which creates a dataframe from dictionary "data" with indexes from the list "labels", replaces the values "nan" in the age field by the mean age depending on the animal's type and returns a new dataframe
9.2 Implement function weight_to_type(data, labels) which creates a dataframe from dictionary "data" with indexes from the list "labels", calculates average weight of each animal type and returns dictionary with these values, where keys are animal types and values are animal weights
9.3 Implement function kittens(data, labels) which creates a dataframe from dictionary "data" with indexes from the list "labels" and returns dataframe with data about cats with age < 3
9.4 Implement function sorted_df(data, labels) which creates a dataframe from dictionary "data" with indexes from the list "labels" which returns dataframe sorted firstly by age in a decreasing order, secondly, for the number of weight in ascending order
10. Markov Chain
